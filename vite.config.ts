// "./maplibre-gl-shared.mjs" - a sibling chunk maplibre-gl ships next to the
// worker in its own package. Vite's `?url` handling copies only the worker
// file itself into dist/assets (hashed), never following that internal
// relative import, so the sibling chunk is silently missing from the build
// and the worker fails to load at runtime. Copy it in ourselves, unhashed,
// so the worker's relative import resolves.
