 * not imported per-page. Previously every page (Home, PostRequest,

 * <MobileNav/>, and page-width wrapper independently; four slightly
 * different implementations of the same frame. This is the single one.
 *
 * SupportChat is deliberately not mounted here — see the 2B report for
 * why (it was a fully mocked widget with no real backend behind it, not
 * part of the approved IA).
